This is the git to my platformer game in python. You can use "a" and "d" to move horizontaly and "w" to jump. For every ledge you jump on you get a point. To play visit the link on itch io or just take it from here https://matek50939.itch.io/platformer-game If you don't want to play in the browser you can copy tho main.py code (click on it and then copy) or download it and then play on a python complier (pycharm is the best one, others might not work). Also you might need to install some modules such as pygame and asyncio(the module for making it web playable)to install the modules go to the terminal and type "pip install pygame" and then "pip install asyncio". I presonally recommend playing on itch.io on the browser. Try not to fall! Have fun!
